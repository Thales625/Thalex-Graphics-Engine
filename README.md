# ThaleX Graphics Engine

This is a graphics engine under development using C++ and OpenGL. Its goal is to provide a solid foundation for creating high-performance and flexible 3D graphics. This engine makes use of libraries such as GLFW for window management, GLM for vector and matrix mathematics, and GLAD for OpenGL extension loading.

## Features

- **Rendering:**
  - Basic support for rendering 3D objects.
  - Initial setup for adding new rendering techniques.

- **Camera:**
  - Basic camera movement with controls for view adjustments.
  - Plans for improvements in movement and camera configuration.

## Usage

After building, you can run the application located at `./bin/app`. The engine currently supports basic 3D object rendering and has preliminary functionality for camera control.
